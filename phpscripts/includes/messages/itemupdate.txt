Dear <<name>>,
Congratulations! We have just received a confirmation from <<buyer>> expressing interest in <<item>>.
It is important that you contact <<buyer>> ASAP for he/she might lose interest in this posting/item. 
You might also want to check your partyHub mail, for it will most likely be used by <<buyer>> 
in order to contact you. If you do wish to contact <<buyer>>, this can also be done through our mail 
system (this way no private information is disclosed). Please DO NOT REPLY to this message as it was sent 
from partyHub and not from the <<buyer>>.

By the way, if you are not aware of this yet, there is a feedback system that you can use to rate your experience with <<buyer>>. 
Remember that by leaving feedback for another user you will be leaving a permanent mark on his/her record - so 
use this tool wisely.
have a nice day,
partyHub team
