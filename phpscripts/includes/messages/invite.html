<p>(fname) (lname) and partyHub would like to invite you to join our growing college "buddy space", 
where you can organize parties, post events, and connect with your fellow "colleagues". But, partyHub is not just 
a place for parties (although partying is definitely encouraged)! it is a space for college guys & gals to 
chat, trade, exchange, discuss, blog, e-mail, and express themselves in more ways than ever. </p>
<p>partyHub helps you keep in touch with your peers! Our goal is to allow everyone a complete freedom while still 
preserving one's privacy and interests. On partyHub.com you can customize the 
appearance of your profile and blogs using css style sheets to show people more of your persona & creativity.</p>
