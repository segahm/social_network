	<tr><td colspan="2"><P style="FONT-FAMILY: Courier New">This guideline is meant to provide both parties (sellers and buyers) 
with a condition standard for trading a book. Sellers must follow this guideline when posting (and later selling) 
their book. If the condition is not met, buyers have the right to return the book back to the seller for a full 
refund (unless the buyer used the book prior to the return). If found that the seller repeatedly violated 
the guideline, the seller's id will be removed from the system. </P></td></tr>
